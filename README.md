### todo-rs-backed

Let me preface this by saying, yes, this is another to do app. And it's written in rust.

Anybody hit a meme tech bingo yet? No? Ok.

This is my plan. And yes, totally impractical. 

I don't want to actually implement Rust in any of my projects because A. it'll slow me down. B. I don't need Rust performance.

But I do want to learn Rust.

So here's my plan. Buckle up buttercup.

A backend... written in Rust.

With a client lib also written in... You guessed it, Rust.  (Put your hand down Steve the bingo game is over)

With this client lib I will expose C headers and build.. you guessed it yet again. A "cross *eye twitch* platform" mobile app.

Is this completely impractical and bordering on insanity? Absolutely. Am I still gonna do it? Yes.

So anyways, here's the backend, probably written using actix and diesel.
